Doc2Frame is a text editing platform that integrates text processing and analysis features for NLP. This project is segmented into multiple phases, with the first phase already completed and the second phase currently under construction. Initially conceived as an end-of-semester mini project for a Python course at university.

The Work done in the Phases are listed as below:

**Phase 1**
- *Create the Core framework of accepting, processing, and analysing the text*
- *Create the Basic GUI design to test out project*

**Phase 2** *(Under planning and work-**COMING SOON**)* 

- *Integrate Genrative-AI features: Working for implementing RAG [Retrieval Augmentation System] onto the platform. Integrate with LLM to create a basic Chatbot with knowledge source as the text input)*
- *Integrating Text cleaning options using NLP/DL/AI* 
- *Text analysis-Graph*
- *Improved Design of GUI*
- *Improving the approaches used int previous phase*
